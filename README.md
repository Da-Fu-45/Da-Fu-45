# From Anchor Chain to BlockChain ⚓

I'm **Andrew**, a seafarer working at sea 🌊 and exploring how tech can make life on board smarter and easier.  
Currently diving into **AI**, **DeFi**, and **automation tools** — both on ship and on shore.

---

### 🚢 What I’m working on
- Personal AI experiments (`sea-ai-lab`)
- Crypto research & staking notes (`crypto-notes`)
- Handy scripts for daily tasks (`my-tools`)

---

### 🧠 Interests
- Artificial Intelligence & Automation
- Blockchain / Solana ecosystem
- Data tracking & analytics
- Life optimization (even 100 miles from land)

---

### 🧭 Fun fact
Sometimes I debug code in the middle of the ocean.  
No Wi-Fi, no StackOverflow — just pure faith and coffee ☕😅

📫 **Reach out:**  
If the sea’s calm and the connection’s good — I’m probably online here.  
Otherwise, just send a bottle 🐚
